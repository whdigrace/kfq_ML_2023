to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

extensive .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                        If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        It has a solid feel to it  , but the battery juts out quite a bit, the touchpad keys are terribly placed, the webcam is only 0 .\\n58

would not operate at all and the computer became useless once the onboard battery ran down .\\n62

the battery indeed lasted over 10 hours, even while watching hours of  .\\n63

over 10% battery capacity remaining .\\n65

                                               I think I will love this machine for the purposes I bought it, portability, battery life to carry me through travels and for my teenager to use .\\n68

I used it for at least 7 hours and Windows still said it had an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .\\n71

fits in the glove box of my car, and serves the uses of a netbook in excellent fashion .\\n73                                                                                                                                   My only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .\\n74

has a great battery life our I'd be out of luck .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .\\n76

puffed up .\\n77                                                                                                                                                               If your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .\\n78              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n79

be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n157

discharge this battery several times before you start using it in the regular mode .\\n186

originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .\\n188

                     What none of the reviews I read told me is that the Asus company recommends that when you are somewhere that has electricity, you should take out the battery and just plug in the machine .\\n190

chose this netbook was that the battery does come out ,  my old laptop had an internal battery, and when it stopped taking a charge, I had to replace the whole machine .\\n192

very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .\\n194

when you want extended battery life, you're on a plane where you don't need full brightness or radio anyway .\\n195

dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .\\n27

hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .\\n31

                       With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .\\n33

took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                  It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .\\n37

                                                         The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .\\n40

I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .\\n44

its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .\\n59

        I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .\\n61

me all night !\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                        I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .\\n65

Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .\\n67

               I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .\\n73

                       The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .\\n78

                                      Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,

                               One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .\\n86

                            Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .\\n88                                                                                       The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .\\n89

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .\\n91                                                                                                                                                               I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .\\n92

.\\n94                                                                                                          They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .\\n95                                                                                                                                    Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .\\n96

filled with nonsensical options .\\n98

and frustratingly easy to advance the page .\\n100

in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .\\n110

screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .\\n112                                                                                                                           My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .\\n113                                                                                                                                             Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .\\n114

just have to push downward on the square button .\\n115

                                                     As highly documented before, the buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .\\n128                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .\\n129

say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .\\n131

                            I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

                                                                                                    The car comfort, looks, performance and fuel economy are great but the paint is a disaster .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                       Front seats are not comfortable on long trip .\\n40                                                                                                I was not sure at first about trading my 01 Honda Accord but have been more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                  Very comfortable ride and seating .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                 Very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .\\n44                                                                                                The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort and options of the Camry .\\n46                                                                                                     The seat comfort is not as it was and I found that the gas, brake pedals are offset too much to the left of my body centerline .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                   Very comfortable, quiet interior .\\n48                                                                                                                                                          Seats are padded more firmly than previous model but comfortable on trips .\\n49

                                                                                                                               Trunk is big and rear seat very comfortable for 2 and will seat 3 .\\n51

great for my 6'1  250 lbs .\\n52                                                                                                                I feel that the Camry just gets better and better in terms of comfort, styling and performance with each generation .\\n53                                                                                                                     It looks awesome, turns like it's on rails, has a great sound system, and is just comfortable and fun to drive .\\n54

                Other than that, technology is mind blowing on this sedan and performance is incredible, with a smooth and comfortable ride .\\n61

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all

Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91

has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of

this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .\\n7

found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .\\n9

whereever we intend to go .\\n10                                                                                                                                         Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .\\n12

get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .\\n17

would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

                  It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions

                                         So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n34

                                                                                                                               The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                    When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .\\n59

Australian, American and British English .\\n60

.\\n61

                                                                                                                                                                                                 In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .\\n63                                                                                                                                    The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

speech feature and 4 .\\n65

                                    Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .\\n67

the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .\\n71

were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .\\n73

which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n7                              The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .\\n8

         UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .\\n10

               In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts

limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n16

                                                                                                So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .\\n18

information .\\n22                                                                                                                                                                                                          The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n23                                                                                                                                Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .\\n24                                                                                                                                                  The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .\\n25                                                                                                                                                              Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I have

             I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .\\n30

night .\\n31   I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n32                                                                                                                                               ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                     The unit speaks

                                                                                     Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .\\n36    I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just

was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                                    and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                               I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .\\n32                                                                                                                                       The lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .\\n33                                                                                                                                            Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .\\n34

                                                                                                                                                              The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                      Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .\\n37                                                                                                           And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                 First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .\\n39                                                                                 Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .\\n40                                                                                                                                  A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .\\n41                                                                                                        I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .\\n42

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          E, ink hardly strains your eyes .\\n45

                                                                                                                                               Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .\\n48                                                                                                                           With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .\\n49

                    The screen is so easy on the eyes .\\n51                                                                                                    The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .\\n52

                                                                                                                                              I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .\\n54                                                                                                                                                     The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .\\n55

 The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .\\n64

                                   The screen is easy on the eyes, easy to learn, easy to turn pages, and the device is more comfortable than a real book or trying to hold the iphone .\\n74

                    They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .\\n4

    If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .\\n6

compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .\\n7

anything Windows has ever offered .\\n8                                                                                                                                 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .\\n9

Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51

I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52

have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54

stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56

ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .\\n54

exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .\\n55                                                                                                            However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                      I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .\\n57

is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .\\n58

the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .\\n60

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a £6 .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

local establishments .\\n25

                                                                                                                                                                 Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

service .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                              There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30



tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .\\n35                                                                                                                                  Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .\\n36

only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .\\n38

     The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .\\n41

                                                                                                                                                                                             I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !\\n46

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68                                                                                                                                      there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                            More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                                                             Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .\\n71

fraction of the cost .\\n72

can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .\\n5

at a nearby market before going in for the night .\\n6

   For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's

fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .\\n12

hotel and you will be charged .\\n13

                                             Nothing disappointed us about our stay and we didn\\x92t even take advantage of the free wine tasting between 5, 6pm .\\n61

                                       Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests .\\n65

                                                          We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !\\n67

are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n70                                                                                                                                                   The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                      The hotel provides free hot drinks and

was considered total loss, not fixable, I would not purchase another camry disappointed is this 2007 camry, gas mileage is not as good as prior years, i had to purchase another vehicle, it was not a camry, made in ky, it was a solid 2007 toyota RAV4 made in japan .\\n73

drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .\\n56

                                                             The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .\\n18

                                                            The keyboard and mouse are my biggest concern for the tiny computer .\\n23

The build quality is very good, and the keyboard, though small, is surprisingly comfortable and has good key response .\\n32

                    The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .\\n36                                   I have briefly tried typing on a number of netbooks since last

after brief acclimation .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                             The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .\\n41                                                                                                       With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .\\n42                                                                                                                                      I think the most important thing on these small netbooks is the keyboard, and this one feels very good .\\n43                                                                                                      I notice the tighter keyboard spacing, but it seems easy to type on, yielding no more typing errors than my bad typing normally yields .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,  keyboard feels well laid out\\n45                                                                                                      The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .\\n46                                                                                                   Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .\\n47                                                                                                                           While I still like the keyboard style of the Toshiba better, the EEE PC has some features that are pretty awesome !\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                     The keyboard doesn't have separation between the keys   .\\n49                                                                                                                                                            I also noticed within the second or third day of use that the keyboard was loose .\\n50                                                                                                                    I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place .\\n51                                                                                                                                                           It did not seem to affect the use of the keyboard but it was a slight distraction .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n53                                                                                                                                                       The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                            The keyboard really works for me .\\n56                                                                                                            It is smaller than a standard keyboard, but after a day or two I got used to it and now I can type pretty fast with few mistakes .\\n57                                                                                                                       I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n58                                                                                                                                 I goosed up the memory to 2G and stuffed a 8G SD memory board in the slot on the right side of the keyboard .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                    The keyboard is just fine for my bony fingers & cruise, on writing speed .\\n60                                                                     And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                               1 The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to .\\n62                                                                                                            It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .\\n63

                  It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world .\\n66                                                                           4 And finally the keyboard doesn't stay fastened down at the top it would seem like an easy fix, I've noted it for repair twice and I still have the same problem .\\n67                                                                                                                       1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue

Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .\\n69

                                                                                                                                  The ASUS is comfortable ,  the keyboard is normal sized, so I don't make any adjustment when typing .\\n72                                                                                                                                                The keyboard took about 20 minutes to get used to, but i'm now typing on it very comfortably .\\n73

                                                                                                   This was actually the one of the things I feared most, but turns out the keyboard is set up real nice .\\n76

Keyboard is more than big enough for regular typing and keys have a nice tactile feel .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                 My favorite part about the Eee PC physically is the keyboard mousepad combo .\\n79                                                                                                                                 The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .\\n80

while I type .\\n81

                               I am 5'10 with large hands and have no problem using the keyboard .\\n83                                                                                                              Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n84

expensive, so if you are ending a trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .\\n92

It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74

           Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and

worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83

                                                                                                                                            I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips

tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86

 Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .\\n36

the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .\\n37

the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .\\n38

                           The parking was free, which was great, and the hotel was conveniently located for public transport, and local attractions .\\n2

vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .\\n4

  Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .\\n12

                               On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .\\n14

However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .\\n16

                                                                                           room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location\\n18                                                                                                                                                                      Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .\\n19

again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .\\n21                                                                                                                                  As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it\\x92s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .\\n22

the city while driving .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                  The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .\\n24

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                          The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .\\n27

hotel in the area .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                                            First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .\\n29                                                                                                                               Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                              Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                          The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .\\n32

needed it .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                              This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .\\n35

the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .\\n36                                                                           The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Onsite parking is available .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                             I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .\\n39                                                                                              I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                            Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !\\n42

was cold .\\n43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          At the hotel, it is valet only parking .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                              I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .\\n46                                                                                        The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .\\n47                                                                                                                     Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .\\n48                                                                                                     Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .\\n49   Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !\\n50

Several have mentioned the charge for parking .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                     It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .\\n52                                                                                                                               Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                  They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won\\x92t have to mess with the parking fees .\\n55

steal .\\n58                                                                                                                                      We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .\\n59                                                                                                                                                          Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .\\n60

                              staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .\\n62

.\\n63                                                                                                                                                                                               Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .\\n64

Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .\\n67

the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :\\n69                                                                                                           I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .\\n70               All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                               Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .\\n72

expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                          Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .\\n75

                                                                                                       I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read

                                                                                                                                                                                the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .\\n22

.\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                 The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .\\n24                                                 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                                And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .\\n27                                                                                                                            To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                     price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !\\n29

drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .\\n30

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                             The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .\\n34                                                                                                                                                       If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .\\n35                          However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                           Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .\\n37

interest with price  low to high  as a default .\\n38

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .\\n40

it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .\\n42

with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .\\n43

                                                                                                                                                                   But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .\\n45

price goes down .\\n46                                                                                                                                            Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .\\n47

apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .\\n48

                                                                                                                                                                       Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .\\n50

     Books are retardedly pricey .\\n51

                       Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .\\n53

                             Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .\\n55

a year due to the low cost of most books .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                        The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .\\n58

down .\\n59

significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .\\n61

London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .\\n60

the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than I'd expected .\\n61

the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .\\n104

                                                Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier,   .\\n8

quiet and no hall noise .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                               The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .\\n14

The view from the rooms is of the river and city, Lake Michigan or of Millennium Park .\\n15

few rooms with a view but not many .\\n95                                                                                                                                                                                      Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .\\n96

room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .\\n100                                                                                                                                the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !\\n101

                  The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .\\n106

near a 4 5 star hotel .\\n107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .\\n108                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .\\n109                                                                                                                                                               The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .\\n110                                                                                                                 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .\\n111                                                                                                                                               So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .\\n112                                                                                                                  Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don\\x92t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .\\n113                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .\\n114                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .\\n115                                                                                                                                           We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .\\n116                                                                                                                                                       From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !\\n117

backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .\\n118                                                                                                                                                                          I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .\\n119                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !\\n120

      Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .\\n121

way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .\\n1

perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .\\n7                                                           Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable

90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .\\n9

drag the map with your fingers !\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .\\n11

                           I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .\\n13                   Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past

satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .\\n6

time .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .\\n8                                                                                                                    One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .\\n9                                                                                                                                             It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n10                                                                                                                                                                                         Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .\\n11                                            Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n12

turn .\\n13                                                                                                                                                                        To make things worse,

                                                 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .\\n15                                                    Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .\\n16                                                                                      The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n17                                                                                    On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .\\n18

                                      I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n26                                                                                                                                                               If you missed

                                So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .\\n28

                                                                     The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                    One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n53                                                                                                                                     I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n54                                  I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .\\n56                                                                                                                                                  I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                               It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .\\n58                                                                                                                                                              It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                         3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n61                                                                                                                                                                                              The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .\\n62

    If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .\\n64                                                                                                                                                     There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                         The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Also, push every icon on every screen you see .\\n67                                                                                                                             In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .\\n68                                                                                                                                                    The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .\\n69                                                                                            Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .\\n70                                                                                                                         Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                            3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .\\n72                                       The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n73                                          The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Sufficiently sensitive touch screen\\n76                                                                                                                                                          Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                             We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .\\n78                                                                                                                                                           The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .\\n79

.\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                    The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                       The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .\\n82

I understand what the verbal instructions were .\\n84                                                                                                                                                3

           The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .\\n94

not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35

with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                                                                                                                                                                                yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                                Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I like the gloss screen fine .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .\\n58

                     The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .\\n59

windows but my screen is totally blank .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I can tell the backlight is on, but all I get is a black screen .\\n61

                              With the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .\\n65

my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .\\n69

                                     The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .\\n87

easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

too cramped .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                          Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .\\n124

        The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .\\n125

 Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .\\n127

                                             The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .\\n128

  I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .\\n129

different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n130

and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n131

and the unit runs great .\\n132

resolution .\\n133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134

actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

                               The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .\\n137

                                  The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .\\n138

should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139

The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :\\n151

I can annotate while listening to the lecture .\\n152

done  the screen is glossy   .\\n153

extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

              This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

probably the biggest drawback .\\n164                                                                                                                                                                                                             Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169

setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170

it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171

                 As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172

fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31

                                It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34

combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

  One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !\\n43                                                                                                            Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property,

                                At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour

              We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .\\n47

                                                                                                                                          I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .\\n55

to the room service .\\n57

breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .\\n60                                                                                                         Lunch and dinner

there is little reason to order room service .\\n62

for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .\\n74   The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast

                                The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n74

problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company

was OK, service very haphazard .\\n133                            It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to

Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .\\n136

  I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .\\n20                                                                                                                                                   Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n21

extremely friendly and cheerful .\\n22

days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .\\n25                                                                                                                                                                    Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .\\n26

                     The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .\\n20

to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are .\\n22

                           1 inches is a bit small, so make sure you check some 10 inch models out at Best Buy or Office Max to make sure you're ok with the size .\\n34

really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .\\n55

any problems .\\n72

Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13                                                                                                     If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

.\\n15   That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .\\n16

behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26

passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39

speed limit is 50 .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                         From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .\\n41

speed limit a couple times .\\n42                                                                                                                      The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

want to open and Win7 almost instantaneously finds what I'm looking for .\\n89

                       Win7 runs faster than Vista, and is more intuitive .\\n94

 I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .\\n113

                      You come to a place like Trip Advisor and it\\x92s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .\\n33

something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn\\x92t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .\\n35

                                                                                                                                                                                        Then it said I needed to update some software I said OK .\\n26                                                                                                                                              5 It came with the latest maps  Garmin City Navigator NT North America 2009  and I didn't have to update it .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The maps seem to be fairly updated .\\n28                                                                                                                                                   I found too many users who said that the traffic update feature   is not all that dependable a feature .\\n29                                                                                                                                          I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n30

                                                                                       Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                             Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .\\n33                                                                                 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                         I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .\\n37                                                                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                   Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .\\n40                                                                                                                                                               Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .\\n41                                                                                                                       One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

                                                                                                                                I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44                                                                                                                                            More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .\\n45

                                                                                                         I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                          MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .\\n49                                                                I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                           Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n52

                                                                       ,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .\\n54                                                                                                                ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                              I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .\\n56

                                                  My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .\\n5                                                                                                                                            I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .\\n6                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .\\n7                    The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n8                                                                                                                                                                                      I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .\\n9                                                                                                       I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .\\n10  First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .\\n11                                                                                     Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .\\n12                                                                            The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .\\n13

than a beep just as you need to turn .\\n25

clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .\\n28                                                                                                                                                                                       The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .\\n29                                                                                     When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                           It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voices seem too robotic .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                      However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                    So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .\\n36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Voice commands were mechanical but clear .\\n37                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                    A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                    the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .\\n40                                                                                                                                                       The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n42                                                                                                                                                          The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .\\n43                                                                                                     I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n44                                                                                                                                     The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .\\n45                                                                                                                                       Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .\\n46                                                                                                  This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .\\n47                                                                                                                     Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n48                                                                                                                                                            I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                          I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .\\n50                                                    I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                          The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .\\n52                                                                                                                                                      There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                   I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The non TTS voice is more pleasant .\\n55                                                                                                                                                  The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .\\n57                                                 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n58                                                                                                                                                   The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .\\n59                                                                                                                                                                                                           I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .\\n60                                                    The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .\\n61                                                                                                                          Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .\\n62                                                                                                                                                                   The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .\\n63                                                                                                                                                                   The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .\\n64                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                       The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The voice is clear and easy to understand .\\n67                                                                                                              Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                      I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .\\n70                                                                                                                                            All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .\\n71                                           What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .\\n72                                                                                                   If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .\\n73                                         I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                          Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                      The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                                                           The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .\\n77                                                                                                                                                                                                 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .\\n78                                                                                                                                                                                                                     From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .\\n79                                                                                                                                                              The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .\\n80                                                                                                                                                          After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .\\n81                                                                                                                                           VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .\\n82                                                                                                                                                                                 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .\\n83                                                                                                                                                                   Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .\\n84                                                 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .\\n85                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The voice commands are excellent and timely .\\n86                                                                                            The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                     The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .\"]\n"
